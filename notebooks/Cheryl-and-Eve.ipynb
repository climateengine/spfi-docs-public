    "This is a slight modification of my [previous code](Cheryl.ipynb), and I'll give a slight modification of the explanation. The puzzle concerns these concepts:\n",

    "- **Possible dates** that might be Cheryl's birthday.\n",
    "- **Knowing** which dates are still possible; knowing for sure when only one is possible.\n",
    "- **Telling** Albert and Bernard specific facts about the birthday.\n",
    "- **Statements** about knowledge.\n",
    "- **Hearing** the statements about knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implement them as follows:\n",
    "- `dates` is a set of all possible dates (each date is a string); we also consider subsets of `dates`.\n",
    "- `know(possible_dates)` is a function that returns `True` when there is only one possible date.\n",
    "- `told(part)` is a function that returns the set of possible dates after Cheryl tells a part (month or day).\n",
    "- *`statement`*`(date)` returns true if the statement is true given that `date` is Cheryl's birthday.\n",
    "- `satisfy(possible_dates, statement,...)` returns a subset of possible_dates that are still possible after hearing the statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous code](Cheryl.ipynb) I treated `dates` as a constant, but in this version the whole point is exploring different possible sets of dates, so now `dates` is a global variable, and the function `set_dates` is used to set the value of the global variable."
