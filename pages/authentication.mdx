# ðŸ”’ Authentication

Authentication to SpatiaFi API is done via OAuth 2.0. Due to the secure nature of OAuth 2.0,
access tokens are short-lived and must be refreshed periodically.

The [Quickstart](/pages/quickstart) guide gave an example of generating an access token using
your username and password, but because this requires periodically transmitting your password,
it is **not recommended for production use**.

This module will walk you through the process of generating a permanent "Client ID" and "Client Secret"
which can be used to generate access tokens without transmitting your password.

In the following walkthrough, we will:
  1. Generate a temporary (~15 minute) access token using your username and password.
  2. Use that access token to generate permanent _App Credentials_ (a `client_id` and `client_secret` pair)
  3. Use the App Credentials to generate a new access token.
  4. Finally, we will use the new access token to access the SpatiaFi API.

:::success Example Code

We have provided example code for this walkthrough as a Jupyter Notebook.
See the [App Authentication](/tutorial/app-authentication) tutorial for more details.

:::

## Generate a temporary Access Token

In the panel below, expand the "Security" section and ensure that "Security scheme" is set to `OAuth2PasswordBearer`.
Then, enter your username and password in the "Parameters" section.

<OpenApiTryIt
    definitionId="auth"
    operationId="auth_jwt_client_token_basic_api_v1_auth_jwt_token_basic_get"
    id="step1"
    onResponse={({ request, response }) =>
    {
        console.log('request: ', request);
        console.log('Access token: ', response.body.access_token);
    }
    }
/>

:::attention Attention

Copy the access token from the response above, as we will use it in the next step.

:::

## Generate a Client ID and Client Secret

Using the access token generated above, we can generate permanent _App Credentials_.
Technically, these are called "Client Credentials" in OAuth 2.0, and consist of a `client_id` and `client_secret` pair.
These are very much like a username and password pair, and should be treated as such.

In the panel below, expand the "Security" section and ensure that "Security scheme" is set to `OAuth2PasswordBearer`.
If you Access Token is not automatically populated, copy and paste it from the response above.

<OpenApiTryIt
    definitionId="auth"
    operationId="clients_create_api_v1_clients__post"
    id="step2"
    needs={['step1']}
    placeholder={( step1 ) => {
        if (!step1) {
            return (
                <Alert variant="attention">
                    Please log in above first. We will use the temporary access token to authenticate to this endpoint.
                </Alert>
            );
        }
    }}
    securityDefaults={(step1) => { return ({
        OAuth2PasswordBearer: {
            token: {
                access_token: step1.response.body.access_token
            }
        }
    })}}
/>

:::warning Warning

The `client_secret` returned above is only shown once, and cannot be retrieved again.
Please copy and store it in a secure location.

## Use Client ID and Client Secret

Now that we have a `client_id` and `client_secret` pair, we can use them to generate a new access token,
without transmitting your password (or `client_secret`).

This is done by minting a new JSON Web Token or JWT using the `client_id` and securely
signing it with the `client_secret`.
This is a somewhat complex process to do manually, but we have provided example code in the
[App Authentication](/tutorial/app-authentication) tutorial.

## Use Access Token to access API

Now that we have an access token, we can use it to access the SpatiaFi API.

In the panel below, expand the "Security" section and ensure that "Security scheme" is set to `OAuth2PasswordBearer`.
