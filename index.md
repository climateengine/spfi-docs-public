# Introduction

SpatiaFi merges the power of geospatial data with the simplicity of a REST API.

## The Trouble with Geospatial Data

### It's Big
No, for real. The entire Earth is photographed an average of 7 times per day.
Just storing that data is a problem, let alone moving it or analysing it.

### It's Messy
Good news is that the data is mostly unusable?
The atmosphere scatters light (the sky is blue!), distorts images (mirages!),
and blocks your view (clouds!)

The camera is also 300,000km away and moving 1000 km/h, and the subject (the Earth)
is spinning at a similar speed.

### It's Unusable
Certainly unusable in its raw format. The sensors from satellites generally
don't give you the data you're looking for. These are pieces of highly specific
scientific equipment that often view light waves *outside* the visible light spectrum.

These aren't family photos taken by your Mom's iPad.


## Solving Geospatial Data

So how does Climate Engine go about solving these issues?

### Focus on What Matters
The API is focused on delivering insights around what *specifically* matters to
you or your business.


### Aggregate to Insights


### Standardize the API
